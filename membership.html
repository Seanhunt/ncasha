      NCASHA and ASHA Hight Point Programs</span><br />
		The American Saddlebred Horse Association as well as its local Northern California Chapter, NCASHA, both offer high point award programs to encourage the riding and showing of American Saddlebreds. PDF’s containing details of each program can be downloaded below. 

        <br />
        <br />
        <span class="style1">ASHA High Point Awards Program</span><br />
        There are many awards programs offered through the ASHA. This High Point program is specifically designed to recognize the achievements of all horses registered with the American Saddlebred Registry competing in all disciplines at all levels. It expands the eligibility requirements and variety of classes that can be counted toward an award. Please download and read the .pdf document below. It contains all the critical information. Keep in mind:
<br />
      </p>
<ul>
  <li><span><em> It is the responsibility of the rider/competitor/owner</em></span> of the chosen horse to make sure a show under consideration for high point purposes is listed in the current year’s ASHA horse show data base: <a href="http://www.asha.net/breed/competitions.php">www.asha.net/breed/competitions.php </a>(choose All Competitions); if you cannot find your show, petition the manager (even for non-USEF licensed competitions) to notify ASHA as to the dates, location, and manager before the competition is held so that it can qualify as a high point show.</li>
 
        </span>
        <li><span><em>It is the responsibility of the rider/competitor/owner</em></span> to notify the show manager that appropriate class results should be submitted to the ASHA no later than 10 days after the show and within the qualifying period of December 1 to November 30. It is also the exhibitor’s responsibility to check what has been submitted for accuracy.</li>
</ul>
