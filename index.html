      <h3 class="style1">Mission Statement</h3>
      <p>NCASHA is a 503(c) 3 corporation. It has been set up for the education about and fostering of regional ownership and enjoyment of the American Saddlebred horse. The organization is a local charter for the national American Saddlebred Horse Association. 
        
        The American Saddlebred Horse Association’s worldwide network of more than 50 Charter Clubs enriches the Saddlebred experience for members. Clubs promote Saddlebreds at the local level and help newcomers to learn more about the breed, as well as offering many equine and social activities for their members’ education and enjoyment. Typical activities for Charter Clubs include putting on horse shows, riding in parades, participating in horse fairs, presenting annual awards, trail rides and other popular pastimes.
        
        The organization is centered in Northern California but has members from all over the state. At least 2 general meetings are held each year. One fund-raising horse show is sponsored annually, as is a final awards banquet. </p>
      <h3><span class="style1">Vision</span><br />
      </h3>
      <p> The vision of our group is to serve and promote interest in the history, breeding, ownership, exhibition, publicity, use and improvement of the American Saddlebred horse. 
        This breed offers an equine experience unlike any other with its intelligence, athleticism and beauty. “In great measure, the retention of those characteristics is due to the stewardship of those who never forgot its heritage or its trials, those people whose hearts beat a little faster at the sight of a good horse and the sound of its footfalls, and it is to them that we owe a debt of gratitude for their wisdom. The American Saddlebred, a breed that is now coming home once again to its rightful place of prominence in American Equine History.” <br />
        (Far Field Farm’s History of the Breed) </p>
